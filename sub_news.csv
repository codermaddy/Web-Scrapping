Order NowNEW DELHI: Walmart Inc’s Flipkart has suspended services, a notice on the Indian e-commerce firm’s website said on Wednesday, as India began a 21-day lockdown to fight the spread of the coronavirus pandemic.Prime Minister Narendra Modi ordered the lockdown from Tuesday midnight, but a central government advisory suggested exempting e-commerce deliveries of essentials such as food and medical equipment in addition to grocery stores and banks.Flipkart, whose services include grocery deliveries, did not say how long the suspension would last.“Our promise is that we will be back to serve you, as soon as possible,” the notice said.Amazon India’s pantry service that delivers groceries was also not available in several cities.
It has not said, however that it is suspending pantry services, only that it will halt orders for non-essential products to prioritize customers’ critical needs.Modi’s announcement led to long queues at grocery stores in cities such as New Delhi and Mumbai as customers began panic buying before the ban came into effect.Even before Modi’s announcement, several cities across India had begun imposing curfews though essential services were allowed.
But different state orders created confusion and disrupted online deliveries, including grocery supplies.Alibaba-backed online grocer BigBasket said its services had been impacted.“We are working with the local authorities for the passes and permits that allow movement of personnel and vehicles involved,” BigBasket said in a statement.The company also said it was booked for the next seven days in almost all the cities it operated in, highlighting stockpiling by customers.In Video: India lockdown: E-tailers suspend service",

New York warehouse workers at FreshDirect and Amazon – the two e-commerce giants emerging as the economic winners in the coronavirus epidemic for their near-monopoly on groceries and, well, everything else – tested positive for coronavirus last week, bringing into sharp focus the high-risk nature of their jobs. Along with gig economy workers – rideshare drivers, couriers, and food-service delivery people – and grocery clerks, the warehouse employees handling the surge in deliveries to pandemic shut-ins represent the “have-nots” of the new coronavirus caste system.
Amazon cut healthcare benefits for part-time Whole Foods employees at the beginning of the year, and its stores have remained open even after employees turn up with the virus, with one New York location shuttering only long enough for a brief cleaning as panicked customers waited to pack the aisles. While Amazon has enacted a $2 per hour hazard-pay wage bump, the small bonus is hardly worth employees’ lives, nor will it cover the high costs of medical treatment for uninsured workers who do fall ill. Given CEO Jeff Bezos’ world’s-richest-man status – and Amazon’s pledge to bring in 100,000 new employees to deal with the coronavirus-related surge in business – the notion that the company can’t afford to treat its workers better rings hollow, and more workers are waking up to the sense that they’ve been cheated."

Amazon workers and their supporters have also voiced serious concerns that the company will fail to protect its hundreds of thousands of employees and delivery workers during the coronavirus outbreak.
Amazon also said it's asked anyone who was in close contact with diagnosed individuals to stay home in self-quarantine, with pay for 14 days .
